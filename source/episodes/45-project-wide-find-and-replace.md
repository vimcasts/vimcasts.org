Vim doesn't have a built-in command for project-wide find and replace operations, but we can perform this task by combining primitive Ex commands such as `:substitute`, `:argdo`, and `:vimgrep`. We'll look at two possible strategies: first using the arglist, then the quickfix list.

In the video, I find all occurrences of `Vimcasts.com` and change them to `Vimcasts.org`. I show two different ways of doing it. This builds on material that was introduced in episodes [41][], [42][], [43][], and [44][].

### Strategy #1 - run :substitute across all project files

The first strategy is to populate the arglist with all of the files in the project, then run the substitute command against them all:

    :args *.txt
    :argdo %s/Vimcasts\.\zscom/org/ge
    :argdo update

This may mean that the substutite command runs in buffers that don't contain a match.

### Strategy #2 - run :substitute across project files that contain a match

The second strategy breaks the substitute command into two steps: find all matches, then run the substitute command only in those buffers that contain a match. Here are the steps:

    :args *.txt
    :vimgrep /Vimcasts\.\zscom/g ##
    :Qargs
    :argdo %s/Vimcasts\.\zscom/org/ge
    :argdo update

This uses a custom `:Qargs` command to prune the arglist of buffers that don't contain a match.

### The :Qargs helper command

The custom `:Qargs` command sets the arglist to contain each of the files referenced by the quickfix list. You add it to Vim by copying these lines into your vimrc file:

```viml
command! -nargs=0 -bar Qargs execute 'args' QuickfixFilenames()
function! QuickfixFilenames()
  " Building a hash ensures we get each buffer only once
  let buffer_numbers = {}
  for quickfix_item in getqflist()
    let buffer_numbers[quickfix_item['bufnr']] = bufname(quickfix_item['bufnr'])
  endfor
  return join(map(values(buffer_numbers), 'fnameescape(v:val)'))
endfunction
```

Or you could install the [vim-qargs][qargs] plugin from github. Credit where due: I adapted this code from [a Stack Overflow solution][qfdo] posted by Dr Al.

### Proposal: :cdo

Vim needs a `:cdo {cmd}` command. It would behave like the [`:argdo`][argdo] and [`:bufdo`][bufdo] commands, except that it would iterate through the quickfix list. The `:cdo {cmd}` command would work as follows:

    :cfirst
    :{cmd}
    :cnfile
    :{cmd}
    etc.

If such a command existed, then we could refine Strategy #2, removing the `:Qargs` step:

    :args *.txt
    :vimgrep /Vimcasts\.\zscom/g ##
    :cdo %s/Vimcasts\.\zscom/org/ge
    :cdo update

**UPDATE** on June 2nd, 2013, [Yegappan submitted a patch][patch] to add native `:cdo` and `:ldo` commands to Vim's core.

### :cdo implementations in the wild

Henrik Nye created a [`:Qdo` command][qdo] in his fork of [my Qargs plugin][qargs]. This takes the slightly dirty approach of populating the arglist from the contents of the quickfix list, then using the built-in `:argdo` command to iterate over the resulting arglist. Of course, this has the side-effect that it changes the contents of the arglist. That's tolerable, but not ideal. Henrik has written up how to [use `:Qdo` for project wide search and replace][pug].

Peter Jaros created [`vim-cdo`][cdo], which includes `:Cdo` as well as `:Ldo` for operating on the location list. Peter's plugin differs slightly from the formula I described above, because it effectively uses `:cnext` instead of `:cnfile`.
