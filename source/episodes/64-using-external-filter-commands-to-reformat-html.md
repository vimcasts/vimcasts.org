We can use pandoc as a [filter][] to clean up <abbr title="what you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr>-generated HTML. Pandoc is a commandline program, but we can call it from inside Vim either using the [bang Ex command][bang], or by configuring [the `formatprg` option][formatprg] to make the `gq` operator invoke pandoc.

I recently saw [a neat trick][hay1] on Twitter from Stephen Hay, who says that:

> Few things clean up CMS-input HTML better than running it through Pandoc to convert to Markdown and then back to HTML again. 1 sec, big win.

[pandoc][] is a swiss-army knife for converting between all sorts of markup formats. You can find [installation instructions on the pandoc site][installing-pandoc].

Suppose we have a `tea-dance.html` file that contains crufty markup, because it was generated by a <abbr title="what you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor. We could clean it up by running this at the command line:

    cat tea-dance.html | pandoc --from=html --to=markdown | pandoc --from=markdown --to=html

This emits a cleaned up version of `tea-dance.html` on standard out.

We're using pandoc as a [filter][], that is: a program "that accepts text at standard input, changes it in some way, and sends it to standard output".

### Running text from a Vim buffer through an external filter

Suppose that we open the `tea-dance.html` file in Vim. We can use the [bang Ex command][bang] to filter the contents of the current buffer through our pandoc pipeline:

    :%!pandoc --from=html --to=markdown | pandoc --from=markdown --to=html

Vim will take the output from that pipeline and use it to overwrite the original text from the buffer.

In a [followup tweet][hay2], Stephen suggests mapping this Ex command to a key so we can run it more easily.
For example, you could add a mapping for normal mode and another for visual mode:

```viml
nnoremap <leader>gq :%!pandoc -f html -t markdown | pandoc -f markdown -t html<CR>
vnoremap <leader>gq :!pandoc -f html -t markdown | pandoc -f markdown -t html<CR>
```

That'll work, but I want to suggest a way of doing it [without leader mappings][follow-my-leader].

### Set up formatprg to filter selection through pandoc

In [episode 18](/e/18) of Vimcasts, I demonstrated how the external `par` command could be used for the task of formatting plain text files with hard-wrapping.
As long as we're using Vim version 8.0.0179 (or newer), we can use a similar technique here.

The [`gq`][gq] operation runs the selected text through the filter specified by [`formatprg`][formatprg].
This autocommand sets `formatprg` for HTML files to use our pandoc pipeline:

```viml
if has("autocmd")
  let pandoc_pipeline  = "pandoc --from=html --to=markdown"
  let pandoc_pipeline .= " | pandoc --from=markdown --to=html"
  autocmd FileType html let &l:formatprg=pandoc_pipeline
endif
```

That means we can filter the current line through pandoc by pressing `gqq`.
Or we can filter the entire buffer by pressing `gg` then `gqG`.
Or we can switch to visual mode, and `gq` will filter only the selected lines.

**Update**: When I originally published this episode, I assumed that the `formatprg` option could be set for each buffer independently.
I was wrong then, but this is now possible since [this patch by Sung Pae][179] was accepted into Vim core.
