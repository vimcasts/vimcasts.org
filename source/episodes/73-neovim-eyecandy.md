This video covers a couple of small but delightful Neovim features.
You'll see how to make Neovim show a live preview of how the substitute command will change our document.
And you'll find out how to make the yank operation highlight the range of text that it copied.

### Live substitution

Vim's `:substitute` command only modifies the document when you execute the command, by pressing `<Enter>`.
In Neovim, you can make the `:substitute` command change the document *live* by setting the [`'inccommand'`][inccommand] option:

    :set inccommand=nosplit

Now, you'll see the document updating in real-time as you type out your substitute command.
If you press the `<Esc>` key, you can abort the substitute command and your document will instantly revert to how it looked before you started typing the command.
If you press the `<Enter>` key, your substitute command will apply and the changes to the document will stick.

Currently, the `'inccommand'` option only influences the behaviour of the substitute command.
In future, it may become possible to get live feedback on other commands, such as changing visual block mode, `:global` and `:normal` commands.

### Yank highlighting

Vim doesn't show any visual feedback when you use the yank command.
The [vim-highlightedyank][hly] plugin changes this, by applying a temporary highlight to the region of text that was yanked.

The highlightedyank plugin works both in Neovim and in Vim (since [version 8.0.1394][1394]).
It makes use of the [`TextYankPost`][TextYankPost] autocommand.
If you want to use the plugin in an older version of Vim you have to remap the `y` command, because that autocommand is not available.

At first, I didn't think I needed to use the highlightedyank plugin.
I was accustomed to the behaviour of the yank command, and I didn't feel as though I needed any visual feedback to help me understand how the command worked.
Even so, I installed the highlightedyank plugin out of curiosity.
I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed that extra visual feedback.
I'm a convert!
