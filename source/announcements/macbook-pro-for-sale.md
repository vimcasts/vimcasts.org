* 8GB memory (maxed out)

The operating system is licensed to me (not to the machine), so you'll have to purchase your own Mountain Lion license for £14.

I purchased this MacBook Pro in April of 2010. It came with 4GB of RAM, and a 320GB hard disk drive. In November 2012, I upgraded to 8GB of RAM, and replaced the hard disk with a solid state drive (SSD). The SSD is smaller than the old hard disk, but it performs much better. These upgrades have given the machine a new lease of life.

I've replaced the standard feet on the bottom casing with Sugru-molded rubber feet, as described by [this article][sugru]. Also, there's a Vimcasts sticker on the lid. I'd like to leave that on as a memento to the fact that this is the machine I used to write [Practical Vim][pv].
