Once again, I'm happy to announce that I'll be running a [Vim Masterclass in London][tix] on October 31st, at [Forward][]. You can [purchase tickets from EventBrite][tix]. The early bird price of £85 is available until 7pm on Wednesday, October 24th. After that, the price goes up to £100, so get in there fast!

This could become a regular thing, now that I'm living in London.
