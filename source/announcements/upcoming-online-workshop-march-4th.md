On Monday, March 4th, I'm going to teach my [Vim Masterclass Online][class]. It will run for 4 hours, from [17:00 GMT][tz]. That’s 09:00 if you live in San Fransisco, or 12:00 if you live in New York. Tickets cost £95 (approximately US $150), but there’s an £80 earlybird offer (approx. US $127) running until February 25th.
