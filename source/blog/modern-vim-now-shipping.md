I'm happy to announce that Modern Vim is now available as a paperback. You can [purchase it directly from The Pragmatic Bookshelf][modvim].

READMORE

Also, that means Modern Vim is now complete.
It's been tech-reviewed, indexed, edited, typeset, and laid out.
If you purchased Modern Vim as a Beta Book, then you should log in to your [Bookshelf Account][bookshelf] to download the latest ebook edition.

On Amazon, [Modern Vim is currently available for pre-order][amazon].
I don't have any information about when Amazon will start shipping the book, but I doubt that you'd have to wait long if you bought from Amazon today.

### Tweet me

Take a picture of your Modern Vim paperback and share it with [me on Twitter][twitter].
In return, I'll give you a high five!

If you're based in the US, then you may well get your hands on a physical copy of Modern Vim before I do!
(It takes a while for paper books to make their way over to the UK.)
