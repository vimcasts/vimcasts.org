I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be running a [Vim masterclass at Strange Loop][stlouis], in September this year. The conference has a [stellar lineup][sessions], so I'm looking forward to it eagerly. I hope to see you there.

Closer to home (for me anyway), I'll also be running a [Vim Masterclass in Berlin][workshops] on April 20th, at LAUNCH/CO.

The early bird price of £75 (â‚¬90) is available until 6pm on Friday, April 6th. After that, the price goes up to £90 (â‚¬108), so get in there fast! Eight tickets are available for each session. I'm happy to offer a further discount to the morning session for students. Get in touch if you'd like to know more.

My book, Practical Vim, is set to be released as a Beta Book in mid-April. I'll be in a mood to celebrate, so please join me for drinks in Friedrichshain after the workshops.

Sadly, the date for my Berlin Vim Masterclass clashes with the [railsberry][] conference (my bad). If you want to do both, don't worry about it. I live in Berlin now, so it's easy enough for me to arrange another workshop here. If you want it to happen, sign up to [bring another workshop to Berlin][berlin].

### St Louis, September 23rd

Tickets for the Strange Loop Vim Masterclass are handled by the conference. First, you must [register for Strange Loop][register], then pay an additional $100 to attend my workshop.

I'm planning to spend a month or so in the US, touring with my Vim Workshops. If you'd like to attend one, sign up to [bring a workshop to your city][want]. So far, it looks as though I'll be making a stop in San Fransisco, New York City, and Seattle. I'd love to do more, so let me know where to make it happen.
