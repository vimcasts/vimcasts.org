I'm planning to take my Vim Masterclass workshop on tour around Europe and the USA this Summer. If you would like to bring a Vimcasts workshop to your town, [sign up with your email address and location][want]. If there's enough interest, I'll try and schedule something where you live.

I'm going to need help. Can you recommend a suitable venue in your town? Are there any local meetups or user groups that might be interested in a Vim workshop? If you can host an event, or help me connect with the right audience, then I would love to hear from you. Please get in touch with drew@vimcasts.org.

### Let me know where I should run a workshop

I'll be making plans over the coming weeks. If you want to see a workshop in your town, **now is the time** to say so. I'm using [wantworkshop.com][want] to guage interest in each location. You'll receive announcements by email first, before they reach the blog and twitter.

Each sign up counts as a vote, so get your peers and coworkers to sign up too. It takes 10 votes to unlock your city, which doesn't guarantee that I'll run a workshop there, but I'll do my best to accomodate it. A couple of days ago, I didn't know where [Bristol][] and [Boston][] were on the map, but now I'm considering running workshops in both cities!

Cast your votes, please!

### Preliminary schedule

I'm currently working hard to complete my book, [Practical Vim][dnvim]. I hope to be finished by the end of this month. In June, I'll run workshops in [Krakow][] and Berlin. In July, I plan to run a few workshops around Europe. So far, likely destinations include [Amsterdam][], [Paris][], and [Barcelona][].

I plan to spend August and September travelling around the USA. Likely destinations there include [San Fransisco][], [Los Angeles][], [Seattle][], [New York][], [Chicago][], [Boston][]. I'll also be running a workshop with Bill Odom at [the StrangeLoop conference][stl] in St Louis.

I'll return to the UK in October. Likely destinations include [Bristol][], [Glasgow][], [Edinburgh][], [Newcastle][], and [London][] (again).

If you can help me to make any of these workshops happen, I'd love to hear from you. Drop me an email on drew at vimcasts dot org.
