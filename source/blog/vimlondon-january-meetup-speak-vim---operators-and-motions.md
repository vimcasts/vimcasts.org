On Tuesday 29th January, [VimLondon][] is holding a meetup with a theme: [Speak Vim - Operators and Motions][jan]. We've got 5 short talks lined up:

1. [Tom Cammann][tom], Intro to Vim Grammar
2. [Drew Neil][drew], When and why you should stay out of visual mode
3. [Jack Franklin][jack], Meet [easymotion][]
4. [Kris Jenkins][kris], Meet [surround][]
5. [Alex Young][alex], Creating [custom motions][motions]

I'm looking forward to this event, because the subject of Vim's Grammar fascinates me. If you'd like to attend, [RSVP on Meetup.com][jan]. The event is kindly being hosted by [Funding Circle][fc]. You can also find the event listed on [lanyrd][].
