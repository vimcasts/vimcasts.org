On Tuesday, April 16th, I'm going to teach my [Vim Masterclass Online][class]. It will run for 4 hours, from [17:00 GMT][tz]. Thatâ€™s 09:00 if you live in San Fransisco, or 12:00 if you live in New York. Tickets cost Â£95 (approximately US $140), but thereâ€™s an Â£80 earlybird offer (approx. US $120) running until April 5th.

This will be the 5th time that I teach this class online. If you're curious how the class works, check out my [recap of the 1st online masterclass][recap]. I'm happy to have the help of [Matthias GÃ¼nther][mg] (aka [@wikimatze][]) this time around. Matthias will be on hand to help out with any technical issues and to make sure that things run smoothly.
