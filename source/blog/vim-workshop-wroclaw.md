READMORE

What can you expect from a Vimcasts workshop? Dirty hands. We learn best by doing, so I wonâ€™t lecture you. Instead, weâ€™ll work through excercises designed to reveal the best practices of working with Vim. The material will tie in with my upcoming book, [Practical Vim][p].

## Future dates for workshops

I'll soon be announcing dates for workshops in Berlin and Krakow. If you'd like to bring it closer to home, make sure you [sign up for a Vimcasts workshop in your town][t]. Let me know where you live, and if there's enough interest for your town I'll add it to my agenda. I plan to run more workshops throughout Europe in the first half of 2012, and in the US in the second half of the year.
