The early bird price of Â£85 is available until 7pm on Wednesday, October 17th. After that, the price goes up to Â£100, so get in there fast! Only eight tickets are available for this session. If there's enough demand, then I'll consider running a second workshop that same week, either on the Tuesday or Thursday.

I've listed the [Bristol Vim Masterclass on Lanyrd][l]. Track the event there, or let the world know that you're coming.
