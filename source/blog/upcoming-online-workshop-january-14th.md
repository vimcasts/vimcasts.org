On Monday, January 14th, I'm going to teach my [Vim Masterclass Online][class]. It will run for 3.5 hours, from [17:00 GMT][tz]. Thatâ€™s 09:00 if you live in San Fransisco, or 12:00 if you live in New York. Tickets cost Â£95 (approximately US $150), but thereâ€™s an Â£80 earlybird offer (approx. US $127) running until January 4th.
