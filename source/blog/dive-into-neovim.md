I've produced 10 new screencasts for thoughtbot, on the topics of Vim 8 and Neovim.
The videos are available now for Upcase subscribers as the course: [Dive into Neovim][trail] (you can watch the first 3 videos for free).

thoughbot have exclusive publishing rights on these videos for a limited period.
I will eventually publish the whole series here on Vimcasts.org for free, but you're going to have to wait for them.
If you're eager to see the videos now, you can [subscribe to Upcase][upcase].
They have lots of great courses on topics like Vim, Ruby, TDD, git, and tmux.
(You might also enjoy the [Navigating Ruby Files with Vim][ruby] course that I produced for Upcase.)

Here are the topics that are covered in the [Dive into Neovim][trail] course:

1. Packages
1. minpac
1. Meet Neovim
1. :CheckHealth
1. Neat little Neovim features
1. Neovim's terminal emulator
1. Create mappings for :terminal
1. Pasting into a terminal buffer
1. Sending commands to a terminal buffer
1. Neovim-remote as preferred editor

I'm pleased with how these videos turned out and grateful that thoughtbot sponsored the work. I couldn't have made them otherwise.
