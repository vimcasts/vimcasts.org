I [started working on Modern Vim][newbook] in May 2017.
To my knowledge, this is the first book to cover Neovim.
I also cover some of the new features in verison 8 of Vim.

### What's a beta book?

The *beta book* label means that it's still a work in progress.
At present, Modern Vim is about 120 pages long.
I expect that the first edition will run to about 150 pages, so the book is about 80% done.
You can buy the beta ebook today and read what I've written so far.
Buying the beta edition entitles you to free updates as new editions of Modern Vim are published.

(My previous book, Practical Vim, was published as a beta book in April 2012.
Customers who purchased the beta edition back then will have received the latest update, which was published in January 2017.)

If you choose to read the beta book, you should be prepared for the fact that it's unfinished.
There will be mistakes; there will be dead-end cross-references.
We rely on our beta readers to submit feedback letting us know about any problems, so that we can fix them.
The end result is a better book for all readers.

### Can I get that as a paperback?

The paperback edition of Modern Vim will ship when it's ready.
I have to write the remaining 30 or so pages, as well as fixing any issues that are reported by my beta readers and tech reviewers.
I hope to have the first edition complete by the end of 2017.

### p.s. my other big news...

I'm expecting my second child to be born any day now.
(In fact, the baby was due to be born mid-October - these last two weeks have passed very slowly!)
Things are about to get pretty busy *chez Drew*, so forgive me if I'm slow to respond to any messages over the coming weeks.
