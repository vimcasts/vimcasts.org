:title: Bring a Vimcasts workshop to your town
:date: 2011/10/05

---

I'm going to run a series of Vim workshops in 2012. If you would like to attend, please [sign up to the Vimcasts workshops mailing list][signup], and tell me where you live. If there is enough interest for your town, then I'll try and schedule it into my tour.

What can you expect from a Vimcasts workshop? Dirty hands. We learn best by doing, so I won't lecture you. Instead, we'll work through excercises designed to reveal the best practices of working with Vim. The material will tie in with my upcoming book, [Practical Vim][book].

## Lend a hand

I need help. Can you recommend a suitable venue in your town? Are there any local meetups or user groups that might be interested in a Vim workshop? If you can host an event, or help me connect with the right audience, then I would love to hear from you. Please get in touch with drew@vimcasts.org.

## Austin - October 2011

I'll be visiting Austin TX later this month, to speak at [SenchaCon][]. I'd love to run a Vim workshop while I'm out there. I'm available on the 27th and 28th of October. If you can help make it happen, please get in touch. And of course, [sign up to the mailing list][signup].
