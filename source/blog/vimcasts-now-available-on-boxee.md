[Boxee][b] allows you to watch movies, TV shows and clips from the Internet on your TV. Ever since Vimcasts launched, people have been saying "[get it added to boxee][r]". Thanks to [Clayton Parker][cp] I am happy to announce that there is now a [Vimcasts app for Boxee][app].

To install the Vimcasts app, launch Boxee then select "Apps" from the main menu. If you reveal the sidebar you should see a search field labeled "title or keyword"; type 'vimcasts' in this field, and you should find the Vimcasts app. Alternatively, you can sort the listings by A to Z, then scroll down to 'V' for Vimcasts. When you click on the icon there is an "Add to my apps" option. Clicking this will add it to your list of applications, making it easier to find next time.

If you experience any problems with the Vimcasts app for Boxee, please describe it in the [issue tracker][tracker] for the project, and Clayton Parker will deal with it.
