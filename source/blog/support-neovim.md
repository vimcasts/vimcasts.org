I've sometimes wondered what could lure me to switch from Vim to another text editor.
On the whole I'm happy with Vim, but the one thing that bothers me is the cruft that has accumulated over the course of 20+ years.
Imagine Vim, but without [the `nocompatible` option][nocp].
That is the promise of [Neovim][].

[Thiago de Arruda][tarruda] has set up a [Bountysource campaign for Neovim][bounty], explaining:

> Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor vim source code

The project goals are ambitious, but if tarruda can realise his vision then Neovim could be to Vim as [Vim was to vi][vi].
I'm excited by that prospect!

In the last week, the [Neovim github repository][github] has seen [a lot of activity][pulse].
It's great to see a community forming around this project.
I'm watching with interest.

It only took a couple of days to raise $10k, which was the initial target.
There are stretch goals for $20k, $30k, $40k, and $50k.
With 20 days of the campaign remaining, I'm looking forward to seeing how much the community will raise.
If you want to help this project, please consider making a contribution to the Bountysource campaign.
