    Vim can shred text at the speed of thought, but learning how can take years. Or you can learn everything that matters in 4 hours by taking this Core Vim Masterclass.

    <h3>Why take the course?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Over the course of study, I'll gradually tease out a set of best practices so you'll build a deeper knowledge of Vim rather than just assembling a list of quick-fix solutions</li>

    <ul>
      <li>learn how to <strong>repeat the last change</strong> using the dot command</li>
      <li>meet <strong>the dot formula</strong> – a 2 step process with 1000 uses</li>
      <li>move your cursor wherever you want it to go <strong>with as little as 2 keystrokes</strong></li>
      <li><strong>DRY up your workflow</strong> with macros – your robotic sidekick</li>
      <li>learn how to <strong>execute your macros across multiple files</strong> using the arglist</li>
      <li><strong>attain enlightenment</strong> by understanding text objects</li>
      <li><strong>Stop using counts!</strong> I will teach you to apply the same change over a visual range with the :normal command.</li>

    <p>If you’ve already read <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a>, then you may be familiar with the concepts covered in this class. The coursework doesn’t correspond to any single chapter of my book, but joins the dots between the most important tips.

    <h3>How the class works in person</h3>
    <p>I teach this class using a combination of slides and live coding. When you sign up for the masterclass, I’ll ask for your github username. The learning materials are in a private github repository, to which you’ll be granted access. We’ll work through a series of exercises that are designed to teach Vim best practices.</p>

    <p>We’ll be using bare Vim (not vi – we’re not savages). You’ll be asked to leave your .vimrc at the door before entering my Vim Dojo.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="small-12 large-5 large-offset-1 columns">
    <h3>How the class works online</h3>
    <p>I’ll broadcast a live stream of my screen and voice using Instant Presenter. We’ll use a text chat room to communicate together as a class. You can ask questions in the chat room at any time, and I’ll pause at the end of each section to answer them.</p>
    <p>We'll have three short breaks of 5-10 minutes.</p>

        I left the Vimcasts workshop thinking for the first time in my relationship with Vim that not only are there many ways of doing things in the one true editor, there might also be a right way.

        Great class. Many fundamental ideas and lots of important pointers on how Vim should be used. Extremely useful for anyone trying to understand the Vim way.

        If you believe in learning how to master tools you use every day in your job as a programmer, learn your editor inside and out. Drew's Vim master class is the gateway to becoming really proficient with Vim.

        I've been using Vim for over a decade. Every couple of years, I attempt to polish the mirror and learn new tools and tricks to make my typing and editing more effective. I'd consider myself a fairly advanced user. This course taught me to return to the basics, and systematically think about the specifics of Vim movement in order to optimize further. I wish I'd had this course much earlier in my career, as it teaches some tremendously effective habits and techniques for using Vim effectively!

        The Vimcasts workshop won't teach you shallow Vim tricks - that you can find online. Instead Drew reveals epiphany after Vim epiphany. You'll learn how the visual, normal and ex mode intersect and how they can be tamed into doing your will. You'll leave the workshop with a pattern language for constructing elegant and robust text operations -- or magic if you prefer. Drew was an articulate teacher and he effortlessly illuminated subtle distinctions that had eluded me during a previous year of full time Vim usage. All in all well worth the time and money.
