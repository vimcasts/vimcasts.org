<p>If you’ve already read Practical Vim, then you may be familiar with the concepts covered in this class. The coursework doesn’t correspond to any single chapter of my book, but joins the dots between the most important tips. We learn best by doing (as Confucius put it: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”). In this class you’ll get your hands dirty, learning best practices by applying them.</p>

  <!-- how it works -->

      
<h3>How the class works</h3>
<p>I teach this class using a combination of slides and live coding. When you sign up for the masterclass, I’ll ask for your github username. The learning materials are in a private github repository, to which you’ll be granted access. We’ll work through a series of exercises that are designed to teach Vim best practices.</p>

<p>We’ll be using bare Vim (not vi – we’re not savages). You’ll be asked to leave your .vimrc at the door before entering my Vim Dojo.</p>
<The class lasts for 4 hours</>

<h3>How the online class works</h3>
<p>I’ll broadcast a live stream of my screen and voice using Instant Presenter. We’ll use a text chat room to communicate together as a class. You can ask questions in the chat room at any time, and I’ll pause at the end of each section to answer them.</p>
<p>We'll have three short breaks of 5-10 minutes</p>

      
      
<h3>What you will get</h3>
<ul>
      <li>a 75 minute screencast summarizing key material</li>
      <li>access to the VimDojo – an interactive lesson plan (vimtutor++)</li>
      <li>a copy of the slides used to teach the course, with annotations</li>
      <li>a 25% discount coupon for Practical Vim</li>
